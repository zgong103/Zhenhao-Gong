abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved inference procedure for the interactive fixed effects model in the presence of cross-sectional dependence and heteroskedasticity.  It is well known in the literature that the LS estimator in this model by [Bai (2009)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA6135) is asymptotically biased when the error term is cross-sectionally dependent, and we address this problem. Our procedure involves two parts, correcting the asymptotic bias of the LS estimator and employing the cross-sectional dependence robust covariance matrix estimator. We prove the validity of the proposed procedure in the asymptotic sense. Since our approach is based on the spatial HAC estimation, e.g., [Conley (1999)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407698000840), [Kelejian and Prucha (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407606002260) and [Kim and Sun (2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407610002034), we need a distance measure that characterizes the dependence structure. Such a distance may not be available in practice and we address this by considering a data-driven distance that does not rely on prior information. We also develop a bandwidth selection procedure based on a cluster wild bootstrap method. Monte Carlo simulations show our procedure work well in finite samples. As empirical illustrations, we apply the proposed method to make inference on the effects of divorce law reforms on the U.S. divorce rate, and the effects of clean water and sewerage interventions on the U.S. child mortality.

### Empirical illustration
The procedure proposed in my job market paper can be applied to the broad empirical literature in economics. One example I used for demonstration is the well-known problem of the U.S. divorce rates that was affected by divorce law reforms around 1970s. By using the standard fixed-effects model, Wolfers (2006) identified the rise of divorce rates in the first eight years after the law reform. The robustness of Wolfers (2006) has been doubted due to: (i) the model he used may not not flexible to capture factors varying across time and state (e.g., the stigma of divorce; religious belief); (ii) the idiosyncratic errors in his model were assumed to be cross-sectionally independent. Kim and Oka (2013) employed the IFE model for the study, which reconciled the conflicting results for the earlier studies and confirmed the findings of Wolfers (2006). But the inference of his model is invalid, since he didnâ€™t take the cross-sectional dependence into account in his bias correction procedure and standard errors estimation. By applying the proposed procedure to the IFE model, I can both correct the bias and provide valid inference for the estimates. I find that, with the proposed procedure, the IFE model identifies the significant effects of divorce-law reforms on the divorce rates, and provides smaller estimates with wider confidence intervals than existing methods.
